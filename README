OVERVIEW

Tag plugin enables you to put "tags" to your articles and make it easier for
you and visitors to classify articles using the tags.

SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS

PayPal has the following system requirements:

    * PHP 4.3.3 and higher. Because of some security issues PHP 4.3.10 or
      higher is strictly recommended. (PHP5 should be fine.)
    * glFusion v1.1.6 or newer

INSTALLATION

The Tag Plugin uses the glFusion automated plugin installer.
Simply upload the distribtuion using the glFusion plugin installer located in
the Plugin Administration page.

UPGRADING

The upgrade process is identical to the installation process, simply upload
the distribution from the Plugin Administration page.

CONFIGURATION

$_TAG_CONF['default_block_name']

    The default name of tag block which will be created during the
    installation. If you  disable/enable the tag plugin, the block
    named $_TAG_CONF['default_block_name'] will also be
    disabled/enabled automatically.

$_TAG_CONF['tag_name']

    Tag name to be used in items (articles), like '[tag:foo]'. You might prefer
    a shorter name like '[t:foo]'.

$_TAG_CONF['max_tag_len']

    Max length of a tag in bytes. Should not be longer than 255.

$_TAG_CONF['tag_case_sensitive']

    If this is true, the tag "glFusion" will NOT be identified with the tag
    "glfusion". When you change this option, you should re-install tag plugin.

$_TAG_CONF['tag_stemming']

    If this is true, each tag consisting only of alphabets will be stemmed.
    For example, tag "realize" will be stemmed into "real", thus tag "realize"
    will be identidied with tag "real".

    WARNING: The stemming feature is still not perfect. For example, 'Firefox'
    is stemmed into 'Firefoxi'. So, I don't recommend you set
    $_TAG_CONF['tag_stemming'] to true for the time being (and forever, maybe).

$_TAG_CONF['tag_check_badword']

    Whether to use a list of bad words. If a tag is regarded as bad, it will be
    replaced with $LANG_TAG['badword_replace'] automatically.

$_TAG_CONF['tag_cloud_spacer']

    A string to be used as a spacer in displaying tag clouds

$_TAG_CONF['max_tag_cloud']

    Max number of tags to be displayed in tag clouds in public_html/tag/index.php

$_TAG_CONF['max_tag_cloud_in_block']

    Max number of tags to be displayed in tag clouds in side block

$_TAG_CONF['tag_cloud_threshold'][X]

    Thresholds of frequency of each tag cloud level. All tag clouds are
    classified in 10 levels (level 0..level 9). Those tags whose number
    is equal to or smaller than $_TAG_CONF['tag_cloud_threshold'][X] belong
    to level X. Each level corresponds to its own class in CSS
    (Cascading Style Sheet), so you can display in different styles tags
    according to their levels.

$_TAG_CONF['replace_underscore']

    Whether to replace an underscore included in tag texts with a space when
    a tag is displayed.

$_TAG_CONF['num_keywords']

    The number of key words to be included in
        <meta name="keywords" content="foo,bar"> tag.
    If the number is 0, the meta tag won't be included.

$_TAG_CONF['publish_as_template_vars']

    If this is set to true, tags will NOT be displayed where they should be
    in the article, but will be published as template vars ({tag_label} and
    {tag_part}) which can be used in 'storytext.thtml', 'featuredstorytext.thtml',
    and 'archivestorytext.thtml'. If this is set to false, tags will be
    displayed in the article.

$_TAG_CONF['menu_indenter']

    A string to indent an item of tag menu

$_TAG_CONF['add_num_items_to_menu']

    Whether to add the number of items to each tag menu item.

USAGE

When you are writing an article and want to put tags to it, just enter

    [tag:your_favorite_tag]

in the article. You can use multiple tags like this:

    [tag:glFusion plugins]

Each tag must be separated by a space. If you would like to register words as
one tag, such as "Zend Framework", you should enter "Zend_Framework". By
default, tags are case-insensitive. For example, the tag "glfusion" will
be identified with "glfusion" or "GLFUSION".

If you want to ban certain tags, you can do so in the admin control panel.
Bad words are also case-insensitive.

If you would like to display "tag clouds" in your site block, just create a
PHP block with the function name being phpblock_tag_cloud.  This block is
create automatically during the plugin installation.

The apperance of tag clouds are controlled with templates
  (in <glfusion>/plugins/tag/templates/) and Cascading Style Sheet
  (as <public_html>/tag/tag.css).

  In case <public_html>/layout/your_theme/tag.css exists, this will be
  preferred over <public_html>/tag/tag.css.

If you would like to display a menu based on tags in your site block, just
create a PHP block with the function name being phpblock_tag_menu. You can
edit menu items in the admin control panel. This block is created automatically
during the plugin installation.
